Implement this issue fully per the requirements.

## Issue #13: Handle fine-tuned model name patterns

## Summary
Fine-tuned OpenAI models use the format `ft:gpt-4o:my-org:custom_suffix:id`. We should strip these down to the base model for pricing lookup.

## Changes
- **search.ts**: Detect `ft:` prefix and extract base model name before matching
- Return a note in the output that pricing is based on the base model
- Add tests for fine-tuned model name patterns

## Context
AgentOps/tokencost handles this already. Users with fine-tuned models should get base model pricing rather than a "model not found" error.

Implement all requirements from the above issue(s). Reference: #13


**MANDATORY BEFORE OUTPUTTING LOOP_COMPLETE:**
1. Run tests — all must pass
2. If you created or modified any Supabase migration files:
   a. Run `supabase migration up --local` — apply your migration to the local DB
   b. Run `pnpm generate:types` — regenerate TypeScript types from the DB
   c. If types changed, commit them: `git add apps/web/src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts && git commit -m 'chore: regenerate database types'`
3. Run lint: `pnpm lint` — must pass
4. Run typecheck: `pnpm --filter web exec tsc --noEmit` — must pass
5. Run `git status` — working tree must be clean (all changes committed)
6. Run `git log --oneline -5` — must show commits YOU authored on this branch
7. Run `/home/jeff/projects/alloy/shared/scripts/ralph-review.sh --worktree /home/jeff/projects/worktrees/tariff-13 --issue 13 --project tariff`
   - If it prints PASS — you are clear to output LOOP_COMPLETE
   - If it prints BLOCKING — fix every listed issue, re-commit, then re-run the review
   - If it prints ERROR — ignore and proceed (review service unavailable)

If ANY check fails, keep working. Do NOT output LOOP_COMPLETE until all pass.
Reading files and writing a plan is NOT done. Committed, tested, reviewed code is done.
